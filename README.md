<h1 align="center">Book Bin</h1>

My goal here is to create an attractive e-commerce book site. The site will have a library of books that users can purchase to be sent to their homes. The site will also feature reviews of books that registered users can write and upload themselves. All books will have a star rating out of five where all registered users can rate the books they have read, with the overall rating being displayed. Registered users will also have the ability to create their own lists which will be displayed on their profile page, for example their favourite books list or their reading list for books they want to read next. These lists could be public, viewable to anyone, or private, only viewable to the user who created the list. Registered users will also be eligable for certain deals/offers and will have the ability to sign up for a subscription service.
